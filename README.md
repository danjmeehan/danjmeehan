## Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dan Meehan 

I am a product manager by day, working at the intersection of code and no-code in my side time.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on moving all of the custom CSS and JavaScript that I have in my Webflow project into Github, and reconnecting it all from there.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more JavaScript - I'm interested in progressing towards building with Jamstack.
